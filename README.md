# Overloading and Constructor patterns in PHP OOP

## PHP Overloading

Basically, overloading as you expect it from Java or other modern OOP languages does not exist in PHP.  
There is "Overloading" in PHP, but it is really a different feature.  

Look for chef_magic to see an example of that in action  
(chef_magic)[chef_magic.php]

## What about overloading constructor functions?

Nope, sorry about your luck.  No constructor overloading for you.

However, there are some solutions to this lack of features which make sense and are accepted as industry acceptable (not considered noob hacks).
